# Chess Mating Patterns

Using automated means of programming to detect check mating patterns via PGN file positions and moves.

# PyChess Parser Approach

This repository contains Python/Jupyter Notebook based parsers that detect various chess mating patterns
(Kill Box, Vukovic, Triangle, Balestra, Blind Swine) using PyChess and Spark as the main base of the operation.

See the sub-directory CoLab_Python_Parser sub-directory for more details.

# Sample Data

The sub-directory More_Patterns contains manually collected data sample as a reference for specific matting patterns.
